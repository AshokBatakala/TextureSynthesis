# TextureSynthesis
This work is still incomplete and code is NOT cleaned. 

unsupervised texture synthesis on 3d human body model using single image.  
create conda enviroment using 
`conda env create -f py3d_env.yml`

# note for me
- only renderer code is included here.
- All the experiments should be put in notebook files ( ex: experiment_1.ipynb )
